# My Vim Configuration

Vim configuration is a never ending journey. I'm planning to explain every line in my vim configuration.

## Plugin Manager

I'm using `vim-plug` as Vim Plugin Manager. It's easy to setup, easy to use and very fast.

Here's how to get it and install it.

```bash
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```
